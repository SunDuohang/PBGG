The PBGG method proposed to perform pattern recognition through convolution, which in turn reduces the search space of the grid map, leading to faster path planning.

The code is implemented in python and is all written in the PBGG.py file.

The maps are then placed in the map_txt folder, where example.txt is the map that corresponds to Figure 3 in the paper.
